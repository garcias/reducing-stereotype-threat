Welcome to the RST Archive! This site presents articles and annotated bibliography recovered from the pre-2017 reducingstereotypethreat.org website. (A [newer version of RST](http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org) came back on line in May 2018, though it's slow and not https.) There are eight [Topic articles](topics) you can explore, covering different aspects of stereoptype threat and its effects. Each article links to [annotated bibliography pages](bibliography), which explain the evidence for the claims made in the article.

The design of this site is intended to be fast, responsive, and minimally distracting, so that you can use it as a resource for self study or for training and workshops. Enjoy!

See the [About](about) section if you're curious about the [history](about/history) of this project, or how the [information was recovered](https://github.com/garcias/rst-archive).
