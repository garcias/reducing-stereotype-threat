  <p>This study used a large national sample to investigate the impact of Barack Obama&rsquo;s campaign and election on racial differences in test performance under stereotype threat. Samples of Black and White adults who had volunteered to complete a series of web-based experiments were contacted at four points during 2008: i) just prior to the Democratic National Convention (Aug 22-24), ii) in the days following Obama&rsquo;s nomination acceptance speech (Aug 28-Sept 2), iii) midway between the convention and the general election (Oct 1-4), and iv) in the days following Obama&rsquo;s election (Nov 5-7). At these times, participants completed a difficult verbal exam using items drawn from the GRE. To induce stereotype threat amongst African-Americans, all participants were told that the exam was useful for diagnosing their intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Results showed that White participants performed better than African-American participants at times when Obama&rsquo;s successes were less salient (Times 1 &amp; 3). However, the performance of Black and White participants did not differ significantly immediately after the election (Time 4). In addition, Black and White participants&rsquo; who watched Obama&rsquo;s acceptance speech (Time 3) did not differ significantly, but Whites performed better than Blacks who had not seen the speech. These results show that the successes of an African-American role model can attenuate performance decrements that typically emerge under stereotype threat, and the degree of attenuation appear to be calibrated with the magnitude of Obama&rsquo;s accomplishments and corresponding positive media coverage. Consistent with other findings (Aronson, Jannone, McGlone, &amp; Johnson-Campbell, in press), these results demonstrate that real-world role models, such as Obama, can trump racial stereotypes, but only when their success and accomplishments are especially salient to fellow ingroup members. A focus on Obama eliminated typical stereotype threat effects only at those times when considerable media attention was drawn to his stereotype-defying accomplishments and not at times when less attention was drawn to his race, associated stereotypes, and his achievements.</p>
