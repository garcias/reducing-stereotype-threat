# The Reducing Stereotype Threat Archive

Welcome to the RST Archive! This site presents articles and annotated bibliography recovered from the pre-2017 reducingstereotypethreat.org website. There are eight [review articles](/reviews/) you can explore, covering different aspects of stereoptype threat and its effects. Each article links to [annotated source pages](/sources/), which explain the evidence for the claims made in the article.

The design of this site is intended to be fast, responsive, and minimally distracting, so that you can use it as a resource for self study or for training and workshops. Enjoy!

See [About](/about/) if you're curious about the [history](/about/history/) of this project, or how the [information was recovered](https://github.com/garcias/rst-archive).
