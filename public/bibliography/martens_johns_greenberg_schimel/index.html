  <p>Two studies examine the consequences of self-affirmation on women operating under stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, male and female undergraduates who had a history of strong math performance completed a challenging math test. Before doing so, students were told that the test was being administered to give the researchers a sense of &ldquo;people&rsquo;s impressions of the problems&rdquo; (control) or that the test measured &ldquo;math and reasoning abilities&rdquo; (stereotype threat for women). An additional condition allowed some women who had been exposed to stereotype threat to affirm an important characteristic they possessed by writing about a time that it had been important to them. Men&rsquo;s math performance was not affected by the stereotype threat manipulation, but women&rsquo;s performance was worse in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. However, women who had self-affirmed under stereotype threat performed as well as women in the control condition. In Experiment 2, male and female undergraduates were asked to complete a task involving spatial rotation after informing them that stereotypes suggest that women &ldquo;have more trouble with spatial rotation tasks.&rdquo; Half the students were given a self-affirmation task and the others were not. Performance of men on the task was unaffected by the self-affirmation manipulation, but women performed more poorly than men without affirmation but performed equally well after they were allowed to self-affirm. These findings show that self-affirmation can reduce the debilitating effects that typically arise from stereotype threat.</p>
